I am interested in taking CMSC320 because I would like to expand my knowledge into machine learning and data manipulation. I had an internship during my last year of high school where I experimented with New York Taxi Cab data, and I was fascinated by the different ways in which the data could be manipulated to reveal hidden insights. Thus, I hope to continue developing this interest this summer through this course.
